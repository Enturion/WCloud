WCloudEMU is a MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++. It is completely 
open source, and is community supported. It is derived
from CactusCore, TrinityCore, and MaNGOS, the Massive Network Game Object Servers, 
and is based on the code of there projects with extensive changes over time to optimize, 
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the ingame mechanics
and functionality. If you wish to contribute ideas or code please visit
